# v1.0

**This is the first version of Jovian's version of the Processing RPG.**

This contains some simplified code of the already previous code that exists in this repository.
It contains all the good stuff:

- Prototype grid
- Character selection
	- Drag
	- Drop
- Collision Detection
	- Character and border
	- Character and character 
- Health points and death checking

There will be more to come: this is far from done...
